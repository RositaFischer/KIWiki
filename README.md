# KIWiki
Wiki with the topic of KI and everything that goes with it, from entry to development!

Above all, a new wiki system should be developed. It should be able to automatically crawl text on the web and add it to the wiki.
The first step is to decide based on the programming language the new system will be created in.
In addition, the scope of functions must be specified.
